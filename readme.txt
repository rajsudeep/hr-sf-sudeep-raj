List of libs:
• React.js -> Creating a quick UI blog given constraint of time leads me to use React to build quick and efficent frontend architecture
• React Testing Library -> help test with 
• Sass -> quick set up of responsive css 
• React Router (didn't add it in time)
• Lighthouse -> light test on accessibility / performance 

// add source code list here 
• components folder -> contains different components used in App (alongside their own modularized styles + tests (tests created if I had time))
• App.js -> parent component for logic (and to add router logic which I didn't have time yet in order to go from /blogs to /createpost)
• index.js -> entry point

// test objective notes here
• only have one sample test I created on the Header component (in components folder), didn't have time to test others but the plan was to test them using RTL practices

TO RUN:
• npm install
• npm start
